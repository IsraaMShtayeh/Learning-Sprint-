# Day 1: Values & Data Types , Operators , Expressions 


## Lesson Summary

In this lesson, we explored Values & Data Types , Operators , Expressions in JavaScript. Here are the key points covered:

- In JavaScript there are two types
  of data types primitive data types
  (null,undefined,numbers (decimal,positive,negative,infinity...),string,boolean(false or true ))
   or Object such as document.
    
- typeof is a javaScript operator that return the type of the operand in form string.
  
- A string in JavaScript stores a series of characters (The first character is in index = 0).
  
- There is many built in string methode such as
   indexof(character), includes(string or character) , toLowerCase() , startWith(string or character) etc.
  
- A string can be any text inside double or single quotes.
  
- There is different type of operator in JavaScript Arithmatic Operator (+ - * / ..),comparison operator (> >= < <= == === != !=== ...) ...
- The Difference between == ,!=  (loosy-goosey ) and === ,!== (strict)
  == checks whether the two given operands have the same value or not. (doing extra steps casting )
  ===  checks whether the two given operands have the same value and type or not.
  
- The Difference between Expressions and Statement
  
  Statement:action we want javascript to take (eg for loop , conditional ...)
  
  Expression: ask javascript for particular value (anything that executes and ends up being a value).
  
- we can  declare a JavaScript variable with the var , the const or the let keyword
 
  let and const : are Block Scope {} , cannot be Redeclared
  
  const : cannot be  Reassigned (unchangable variable)
  
  var :  can be Redeclared and Reassigned.
  
-  Variable names (Camel Case such as validVariable) can contain letters, digits but cannot start with a digit 0-9.
